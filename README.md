# A port of @garybernhardt's 'selecta' to Rust

I'm implementing this in order to learn Rust. I picked selecta as a project
because it's small, easy to understand and well-specced.

# Requirements

The latest Rust and Cargo versions must be installed. Update to the latest combined Rust and Cargo Nightly build regularly with the command: ```curl -sS https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sudo bash```

It has been tested against the Rust 1.0.0-alpha version and successfully compiles with these Nightly versions:

 - rustc 1.0.0-nightly (30e1f9a1c 2015-03-14) (built 2015-03-15)
 - cargo 0.0.1-pre-nightly (07cd618 2015-03-12) (built 2015-03-13)

# Build and run the specs

        $ cargo test

That's it.

# Progress so far...

Only the scoring is fully implemented and configuration has been barely started.

# Help?

If anyone wants to help and learn Rust along the way, let me know!
