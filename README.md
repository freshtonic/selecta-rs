# A port of @garybernhardt's 'selecta' to Rust

I'm implementing this in order to learn Rust. I picked selecta as a project
because it's small, easy to understand and well-specced.

# Requirements

Rust and Cargo must be installed.

I've only tested against the Rust 1.0.0-alpha version.

# Build and run the specs

        $ cargo test

That's it.

# Progress so far...

Only the scoring is fully implemented and configuration has been barely started.

# Help?

If anyone wants to help and learn Rust along the way, let me know!
